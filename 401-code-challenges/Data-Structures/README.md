# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Some methods for single linked list. 
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
1. Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
2. Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
3. Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and returns a collection all of the current Node values in the Linked List.
4.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. insert: Big O time is O(1), space is O(1),
2. includes: Big O time is O(n), space is O(1),
3. print: Big O time is O(n), spce is O(n).
4. append:
5. insertBefore:
6. insertAfter
